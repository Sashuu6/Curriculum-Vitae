    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      SI am a NERD and a linux enthusiast, having an average knowledge on working of linux 
      and their distributions. I am also a huge enthusiast in hardware programming. 
      Implementing my software on a hardware gives me an immense satisfaction on my work. 
      I was really interested in electronics since my childhood and was really determined 
      to get into applied electronics engineering. But, my low score in 12th shattered my 
      dream. Then I got into Christ Nagar College for my Bachelor in Computer Applications 
      [BCA]. Things started looking up. After my BCA, I got into College of Engineering 
      Trivandrum for my Masters in Computer Applications [MCA]. My masters drgree opened me 
      to a large bandwidth of oppurtunies to continue on my dream. My hobbies include 
      working on hardware and art.

        This college is affliliated under KTU University. This college gave a different 
        level exposure to new oppurtunies. In this college I met the person who changed 
        my programming life, Mr Aswin Karuvally. He showed me the importance of linux 
        and its working. He also introduced me to IOT devices which included arduino 
        uno, raspberry pi, beaglebone etc. With the immense support my HOD Prof. 
        John Prakash, I could complete many projects which includes both hardware and 
        software.

        languages in this degree. The languages include C,C++ (with data structures), 
        JAVA, Visual Basic, SQL, PHP, HTML and CSS. This helped me along with android 
        development (which I learned via internet) to develop my final project. My final 
        Project was an android application which could be used as to dynamically remap ECU 
        using raspberry pi.

experiences:
    - role: Co-Founder

      company: Radsys Global PVT LTD
      details: |
        This was my first startup. This startup was found by me and my friend (now enemy). 
        First I made websites for others under this company's name. Then, we moved into 
        proof-reading of documents for a company. This gave us a decent income till my 
        friend flew away with the revenue. The best part was that, I was the person who 
        put the money in it. The second best part was that I was using my college semester 
        fee. The ultimate part is that, the company we were taking contracts was a fraudulant
         company. This situation taught me, not to trust anybody.
